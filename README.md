## Hey! My name's Kenneth Irving!
Working on several projects right now, including an automated misting system for my garden, as well as tryna get that bachelors degree!

Obviously, some of my hobbies include programming and gardening, but I also enjoy astrophotography as a side hobby, as well as regular photography.
